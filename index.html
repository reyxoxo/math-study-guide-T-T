         <h1>Unit One: Transformations</h1>
        </center> 
        <h2>Translations: when you move a shape without rotating or resizing it. You can move it up, down, left, or right, or all four!</h2p>
        <h2>Refections: Flipping a shape/coordinate over the x or y axis.</h2>
            <p>If a point is refelcted over the x axis, the the y coordinates change signs. If a point is reflected over the y axis, the x values change signs. For example, (6,7) reflected over the x axis becomes (6,-7) and (6,7) reflected over the y axis becomes (-6,7).</p>
        <h2>Rotations refer to when a number is quite literally rotated around the origin (0,0)</h2>
        <center> 
        <img src= "https://preview.redd.it/demon-slayer-graph-template-v0-jbhj5az52lja1.png?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=e3d94b4906f80495c7152df913d599cdf73614ad" alt "kny graph teeheehee">
            </center>
            <p>Typically, counterclockwise rotations are used. The order goes:</p>
            <p>90 degrees CCW: (-y,x)</p>
            <p>180 degrees CCW: (-x,-y)</p>
            <p>90 degrees CCW: (y,-x)</p>
            <p>However, when its rotaed clockwise, its the opposite. Shocker!!</p>
            <p>90 degrees CCW: (y,-x)</p>
            <p>180 degrees CW: (-x,-y)</p>
            <p>90 degrees CCW: (-y,x)</p>
        <h2>Dilations are next! Sigh...</h2>
            <p>Dilations mean to change the size of a shape, or change a point's placement on a graph. If it's a fraction (like 6/7) then the size of the shape shrinks. If it's a larger number, like 6 or 7, it grows!</p>
            <p>For example, a point located at (6,7) dilated by 2 would be (12, 14). Likewise, the point (12,14) dilated by 1/2 would be (6,7).</p>
        <h2>Moving onto parent functions!!</h2>
            <p>The ones on the test are quadratic, sqare rooted, linear, exponential, absolute value, and cubed.</p>
            <p>Fuctions always need to pass the vertical line test. Put a finger against the graph, and as you move it from left to right, no part of the fuction should come twice. Or, just make sure none of the x values repeat.</p>
            <p>Traslations can be given to these fuctions by putting a number in front of them. For example, (x+6)^2 would mean to move the function of x^2 left 6 units.</p>
            <p>The key thing about horizontal translations on parent functions as that they move the opposite way. From the origin, if you had the function (x+7)^2, it would move 7 units left. However, if you had (x-6)^2, it would move 6 units right.</p>
            <p>Similar to how the translations move opposite ways, when a fuction is stretched or compressed, this also works. A fraction (6/7) stretches the fuction, while a number like 6 or 7 compresses the function.</p>
            <p>Also, if a negative sign is placed before the fuction, it flips.</p>
        <h2>Moving onto domain and range. There are two ways to write the answer for this, interval and inequality notation.</h2>
            <p>Domain refers to the set of all possible x-values for a function, while range refers to the set of all possible y-values for a function.</p>
            <p>Inequality notation is written using >, <, >=, and <=.</p>
            <p>Interval notation is written using parentheses and brackets. Parentheses mean that the number is not included, while brackets mean that the number is included.</p>
        <h2>Next, Relative and Absolute maximums.</h2>
            <p>A relative maximum is the highest point in a specific interval of a function, while an absolute maximum is the highest point in the entire domain of a function.</p>
            <p>It's the same for miminums, but its the smallest number rather than the largest.</p>
        <h2>Finally, end behavior.</h2>
            <p>All this means is what happens to the y-values as the x-values go to positive infinity or negative infinity.</p>
            <p>For example, in the function f(x) = x^2, as x goes to positive infinity, y also goes to positive infinity. As x goes to negative infinity, y still goes to positive infinity.</p>

        <h1>Triangle Congruence and Similarity</h2>
        <img src= "https://i.pinimg.com/736x/88/8e/20/888e209cef1e26cc8254f56810d74c65.jpg" alt "aaa">

        </center>
        <h2>There are four ways to prove triangle congruence: SSS, SAS, ASA, and AAS.</h2>
            <p>SSS stands for side-side-side, meaning that all three sides of one triangle are congruent to the three sides of another triangle.</p>
            <p>SAS stands for side-angle-side, meaning that two sides and the angle between them in one triangle are congruent to two sides and the angle between them in another triangle.</p>
            <p>ASA stands for angle-side-angle, meaning that two angles and the side between them in one triangle are congruent to two angles and the side between them in another triangle.</p>
            <p>AAS stands for angle-angle-side, meaning that two angles and a non-included side in one triangle are congruent to two angles and a non-included side in another triangle.</p>
        <h2>There are also two ways to prove triangle similarity: AA and SSS. CONGRUENCE AND SIMILARITY ARE NOT THE SAME.</h2>
            <p>AA stands for angle-angle, meaning that two angles in one triangle are congruent to two angles in another triangle. This is enough to prove similarity because the third angles must also be congruent.</p>
            <p>SSS stands for side-side-side similarity, meaning that the corresponding sides of two triangles are proportional.</p>
            <p>CPCTC stands for corresponding parts of congruent triangles are congruent.</p>
            <p>This refers to the fact that if two triangles are congruent, then all corresponding parts (sides and angles) are also congruent.</p>
            <p>When making a flowchart for triangle congruence, you must use the correct postulate or theorem to prove that the triangles are congruent. Always list the givens first, and make sure they are in the order that can prove the congruence.</p>
        <h2>Next, parallel lines, transversals, and special angle pairs.</h2>
            <p>When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, several special angle pairs are formed.</p>
            <p>Vertical angles are always congruent.</p>
            <p>Corresponding angles are congruent when the lines are parallel.</p>
            <p>Alternate interior angles are congruent when the lines are parallel.</p>
            <p>Alternate exterior angles are congruent when the lines are parallel.</p>
            <p>Same-side interior angles are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees) when the lines are parallel.</p>
            <p>Same-side exterior angles are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees) when the lines are parallel.</p>
            <p>Something to remember, is that two inside angles add up to the outside angle, if that's what you're trying to find.</p>
        <h2>Next, midsegment theorem.</h2>
            <p>The midsegment of a triangle is a line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of the triangle.</p>
            <p>The midsegment is parallel to the third side of the triangle and half its length.</p>

        <h1>Unit 3: QUADRATICS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH</h1>
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/15/3a/4d/153a4d5639c0a4b1aed52e4eaa34a7d5.jpg" alt "aaa">
            <p>(pov my mom forcing me to do work for this unit)</p>
            </center> 
            <p>Firstly, polynomials. These are expressions that contain variables, coefficients, and exponents. The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the expression.</p>
            <p>Polynomials typically are solved by FOILing (first, outer, inner, last), and then combining like terms.</p>
            <p>There are different types of polynomials. Monomials, which are a single term, binomials, meaning two terms, and polynomials, meaning multiple terms.</p>
            <p>Perfect square trinomials are polynomials that can be factored into the square of a binomial.</p>
        <h2>Next, standard form of a quadratic equation.</h2>
            <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation is ax^2 + bx + c = 0.</p>
            <p>To solve a quadratic equation in standard form, you can use factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula.</p>
        <h2>How do you know what to use for what kind of quadratic equation?? I wonder...</h2>
            <p>Factoring works when the quadratic can be easily factored. Completing the square is useful when the coefficient of x^2 is 1 and the coefficient of x is even. The quadratic formula works for all quadratics, but it's more complex.</p>
            <p>The discriminant is b^2 - 4ac. If the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions. If it's zero, there is one real solution. If it's negative, there are no real solutions.</p>
        <h2>Next, vertex form of a quadratic equation.</h2>
            <p>The vertex form of a quadratic equation is y = a(x-h)^2 + k, where (h,k) is the vertex of the parabola.</p>
            <p>To convert from standard form to vertex form, you can complete the square.</p>
            <p>To go from vector form to standard form, you can expand the equation and simplify.</p>
            <p></p>
        <h2>Finally, graphing quadratics.</h2>
            <p>To graph a quadratic function, you can plot points or use the vertex and axis of symmetry.</p>
            <p>The axis of symmetry is x = -b/2a.</p>
            <p>The vertex is the point (h,k) in vertex form, or (-b/2a, f(-b/2a)) in standard form.</p>
            <p>The y-intercept is the point where x = 0.</p>
            <p>The x-intercepts are the points where y = 0 (also called roots or zeros).</p>
            <p>You need to pay attention to the y values specifically for this.</p>
        <h2>Finally, Projectile motion.</h2>
            <p>Projectile motion is the motion of an object that is thrown or launched into the air at an angle. The path of a projectile is a parabola.</p>

        <h1>Unit 4: Exponents and Radicals.</h1>
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/1200x/d3/92/50/d39250ca81619ba16ccb6aade901fadd.jpg" alt "glup...">
            </center> 
            <p>When working with exponents, remember the following rules:</p>
            <p>Product rule: a^m * a^n = a^(m+n)</p>
            <p>Quotient rule: a^m / a^n = a^(m-n)</p>
            <p>Power rule: (a^m)^n = a^(mn)</p>
            <p>Zero exponent: a^0 = 1 (a ≠ 0)</p>
            <p>Negative exponent: a^-n = 1/a^n</p>
            <p>Rational exponents: a^(m/n) = (a^m)^(1/n) = (a^(1/n))^m</p>
        <h2>Radicals</h2>
            <p>The square root of a number x is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives x. It is denoted as √x.</p>
            <p>To simplify radicals, factor the number inside the radical and look for perfect squares.</p>
            <p>To add or subtract radicals, the radicals must have the same index and radicand.</p>
            <p>To multiply radicals, you can multiply the radicands together under a single radical.</p>
            <p>To divide radicals, you can divide the radicands under a single radical.</p>
        <h2>Direct and Indirect variation</h2>
            <p>Direct variation is when two variables are related in such a way that as one variable increases, the other variable also increases proportionally. It can be represented by the equation y = kx, where k is the constant of variation.</p>
            <p>Indirect variation (or inverse variation) is when two variables are related in such a way that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases proportionally. It can be represented by the equation xy = k, or y = k/x, where k is the constant of variation.</p>

        <h1>Unit 5: Trig!!!!!
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f3/7c/f2/f37cf2f02c02d83e583965de08f41a57.jpg" alt "trig aaa">
            <p>(this unit was actually fun ngl)</p>
        </center> 
        <h2>First, the basic trig functions: sine, cosine, and tangent.</h2>
            <p>Sine (sin) of an angle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle.</p>
            <p>Cosine (cos) of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle.</p>
            <p>Tangent (tan) of an angle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the adjacent side in a right triangle.</p>
            <p>These functions are often remembered using the acronym SOHCAHTOA.</p>
            <p>They're used when finding a missing side for a RIGHT triangle.</p>
            <p>Whenever finding a missing angle, you can use inverse trig functions, like sin^-1, cos^-1, and tan^-1.</p>
        <h2>Next, the Pythagorean Theorem and its converse.</h2>
            <p>The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotnuse is equal to the sum of the sqaures of the other two sides. The formula for the pythagorean theorem is a^2 + b^2 = c^2</p>
        <h2>Finally, Angle of elevation and angle of depression!!</h2>
            <p>The angle of elevation/depression is a measure of a person's view of something up or down.</p>
        
        <center>
        <h1>Unit 6: Probability</h1>
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/b9/f3/36/b9f33631983678389ac4086c37d18a2b.jpg"
        <center> 
        <h2>Factorials, Permutations, and combinations</h2>    
            <p>Factorials are numbers with exclamation marks after them, like 6! or 7!, which just essentially mean that you multiply all positive integers less than or equal to that number. So 7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040.</p>
            <p>Permutations are arrangements of objects where order matters. The number of permutations of n objects taken r at a time is nPr = n! / (n - r)!.</p>
            <p>Combinations are arrangements of objects where order does not matter. The number of combinations of n objects taken r at a time is nCr = n! / (r!(n - r)!).</p>
            <p>How to know when to use either?? You use permutations when the order of the objects matters, and combinations when it doesn't.</p>
        <h2>Theoretical and exponential Probability</h2>
            <p>Theoretical probability is the probability of an event occurring based on mathematical calculations. It is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.</p>
            <p>Experimental probability is the act of conducting an active experiment to see how the probabibily is in real time.</p>
        <h2>Simple events, compound events, and independent and dependent events</h2>
            <p>A simple event consists of only one outcome, like rolling a dice or getting a 6 (or a 7).</p>
            <p>A compound event consists of two or more simple events, like rolling a dice TWICE and rolling a 6 on the first try, and a 7 n the second try.</p>
            <p>Independent events are events where the outcome of one event doesn't effect the other. Dependednt events are the opposite- in which one event influences another.</p>
        <h2>Tree diagrams</h2>
            <p>Tree diagrams are visual reresentations of the possibilities of how different events can occur.</p>
