        <h1>Unit One: Transformations</h1>
        <h2>Translations: when you move a shape without rotating or resizing it. You can move it up, down, left, or right, or all four!</h2p>
        <h2>Refections: Flipping a shape/coordinate over the x or y axis.</h2>
            <p>If a point is refelcted over the x axis, the the y coordinates change signs. If a point is reflected over the y axis, the x values change signs. For example, (6,7) reflected over the x axis becomes (6,-7) and (6,7) reflected over the y axis becomes (-6,7).</p>
        <h2>Rotations refer to when a number is quite literally rotated around the origin (0,0)</h2>

            <p>Typically, counterclockwise rotations are used. The order goes:</p>
            <p>90 degrees CCW: (-y,x)</p>
            <p>180 degrees CCW: (-x,-y)</p>
            <p>90 degrees CCW: (y,-x)</p>
            <p>However, when its rotaed clockwise, its the opposite. Shocker!!</p>
            <p>90 degrees CCW: (y,-x)</p>
            <p>180 degrees CW: (-x,-y)</p>
            <p>90 degrees CCW: (-y,x)</p>
        <h2>Dilations are next! Sigh...</h2>
            <p>Dilations mean to change the size of a shape, or change a point's placement on a graph. If it's a fraction (like 6/7) then the size of the shape shrinks. If it's a larger number, like 6 or 7, it grows!</p>
            <p>For example, a point located at (6,7) dilated by 2 would be (12, 14). Likewise, the point (12,14) dilated by 1/2 would be (6,7).</p>
        <h2>Moving onto parent functions!!</h2>
            <p>The ones on the test are quadratic, sqare rooted, linear, exponential, absolute value, and cubed.</p>
            <p>Fuctions always need to pass the vertical line test. Put a finger against the graph, and as you move it from left to right, no part of the fuction should come twice. Or, just make sure none of the x values repeat.</p>
            <p>Traslations can be given to these fuctions by putting a number in front of them. For example, (x+6)^2 would mean to move the function of x^2 left 6 units.</p>
            <p>The key thing about horizontal translations on parent functions as that they move the opposite way. From the origin, if you had the function (x+7)^2, it would move 7 units left. However, if you had (x-6)^2, it would move 6 units right.</p>
            <p>Similar to how the translations move opposite ways, when a fuction is stretched or compressed, this also works. A fraction (6/7) stretches the fuction, while a number like 6 or 7 compresses the function.</p>
            <p>Also, if a negative sign is placed before the fuction, it flips.</p>
            <h2>Moving onto domain and range. There are two ways to write the answer for this, interval and inequality notation.</h2>
